# 🧩 React Playground

A personal space to practice and explore React + TypeScript + Tailwind.  
This project serves as a foundation for experimenting with hooks, patterns, and component behavior as I learn.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 18** – component-based UI library  
- **TypeScript** – static typing for safer and clearer code  
- **Vite** – fast build and dev server  
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling framework  
- **React Router DOM** – navigation between learning pages  

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository will be used to:

- Build and test concepts as I learn React deeply  
- Keep a record of my progress and code experiments  
- Gradually expand with different pages for each hook and concept  

---

## 🪶 Getting Started

```bash

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/drumil1530/react-playground.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps

- Add pages for `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and others
- Write small examples showing practical hook usage
- Document learnings and notes for each topic
