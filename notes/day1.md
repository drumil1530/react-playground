# 🧩 Day 1 — useState Exploration

**Date:** 12 Oct 2025  
**Focus:** Understanding `useState` and its behavior through small projects.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Counter App**
   - Implemented increment, decrement, and reset.
   - Realized `++` and `--` operators don’t work directly with `useState` since React’s state updates are not immediate.

2. **Todo App (Mini)**
   - Added and deleted tasks.
   - Got stuck when trying to delete specific tasks by index:

     ```ts
     setList((prev) => prev.filter((t) => list.indexOf(t) !== index));
     ```

     ❌ This removed all items with the same value because `indexOf()` always returns the first match.  
     ✅ Fixed it with:

     ```ts
     setList((prev) => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
     ```

     - Learned that the `filter` callback’s second argument (`i`) is the actual element index and is much safer here.
   - Mark-complete and localStorage persistence still pending.

3. **Form State**
   - Managed multiple inputs (`name`, `email`, `age`).
   - Displayed a live summary as the user typed.
   - TypeScript made the process more reliable — typing forms and states gave clarity and fewer mistakes.

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Realizations

1. **`useState` updates are asynchronous.**  
   You can’t rely on the immediate value right after calling `setState`.

2. **Use updater function for previous value.**  

   ```ts
   setCount(prev => prev + 1);
   ```

3. **Primitive vs Complex states.**
   Arrays and objects need to be spread/cloned, not mutated.

4. **Re-renders only occur when state changes.**
   Calling `setState` with the same value doesn’t trigger a render.

5. **TypeScript with `useState`.**

   - Explicit typing helps with empty arrays, nulls, or objects.
   - Example:

     ```ts
     const [list, setList] = useState<string[]>([]);
     ```

6. **Reusability starts early.**
   Built small reusable components (`Button`, `Input`) to avoid repetition.

7. **Muscle memory is rusty but returning.**
   Remembering React + TS syntax took time but felt natural again after practice.

## ⚙️ Reflection

It took longer than expected (~2 hours setup + 4 hours coding), but every minute was worth it.
By the end, `useState` felt more natural — not as a black box, but as a mechanism that re-renders only when state *actually* changes.

The key mistake I made (using `list.indexOf(t)`) taught me how easy it is to misunderstand array operations inside React state logic — and how cleaner patterns (`(_, i) => i !== index`) solve it elegantly.

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Finish pending features in the Todo app:

  - Mark complete toggle
  - LocalStorage persistence (via `useEffect`)
- Move to **useEffect** experiments next.
- Add simple Tailwind styling for better visual distinction.
